# Cash-Flow-Minimizer

A small project called Minimizer was created utilizing a graph data structure. 
We put an algorithm into practice to determine the bare minimum cash flow required to pay off obligations for a collection of people.
It finds and settles transactions between creditors and debtors using a recursive method until all debts are paid off.
The program computes the net amounts owed by each individual, settles the least of their net amounts, and finds the maximum creditor and debtor in each phase.
This algorithm, which provides a clear example of debt resolution in a group environment, is a simplified version of the "Minimum Cash Flow to Settle Debts" algorithm.
