# Cash-Flow-Minimizer-
Cash Flow Minimizer is a mini project build by using graph data structure 
We implements an algorithm to find the minimum cash flow needed to settle debts among a group of individuals.
It utilizes a recursive approach to identify and resolve transactions between creditors and debtors until all debts are settled.
The algorithm calculates net amounts owed by each person, determines the maximum creditor and debtor in each step, and settles the minimum of their net amounts.
The algorithm is a simplified version of the "Minimum Cash Flow to Settle Debts" algorithm, offering a clear illustration of debt resolution in a group setting.
